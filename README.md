# Malnutrition Dashboard 

## Problem Statement
Malnutrition, in the context of undernutrition, represents a significant public health challenge, particularly in low to middle-income countries like Nigeria. Undernutrition is defined by specific criteria:

Neonates (newborns): Any newborn with a birth weight less than 2500 grams (5.5 lbs).
Children under five:
Children who are underweight, indicated by a weight-for-age Z-score of less than -2.

Malnutrition, contributes to severe morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The primary drivers of malnutrition include socio-economic conditions, inadequate water and sanitation, lack of nutritional education for mothers on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections. The most vulnerable populations are children under five and pregnant and lactating women.
Despite its critical importance, malnutrition is often underreported, leading to challenges in effectively addressing the issue.

This dashboard focuses on data from the 2013 Nigerian Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system to analyze malnutrition cases observed, reported, and investigated, along with total deaths attributed to malnutrition across various states and LGAs. Although the dataset originally included data from 2013 and 2015, discrepancies in the 2015 dataâ€”such as only 28 cases reported, all in Rivers State, with no deaths or investigations, This may be due to errors in data entry or errors from our data source, since we have means to further investigate this, that year was excluded from the analysis. As a result, this dashboard drills down to focus solely on the 2013 data.

## Data Cleaning
To ensure the dataset was focused and accurate for analyzing malnutrition among the under-five population, the following data cleaning steps were taken using Power BI's Power Query:

a. Filtering Disease Data: The dataset initially included multiple diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and pneumonia. The Disease column was filtered to retain only malnutrition data.

b. Age-Specific Aggregation: Columns containing malnutrition data for other age groups were removed. New columns were created to aggregate total cases observed, investigated, and deaths specifically for the under-five age group.

c. Sorting: The data was sorted by state, LGA, and month of the year to facilitate analysis by geographic and temporal factors.

d. Excluding 2015 Data: The dataset originally included data for 2013 and 2015. However, the 2015 data showed significant discrepancies, such as no recorded deaths across all states, which raised doubts about its accuracy. Since further investigation was not possible, the 2015 data was omitted, and the focus was placed solely on the 2013 data.

e. Date Formatting: The dataset contained month and year as separate columns, which could cause issues when plotting line graphs in Power BI. A new column was created to combine these into a proper date format, using the first day of each month as a reference.

f. Missing Data: It was observed that there was no data available for Adamawa state. No explanation or information was provided on the data page for this omission.

## Objectives:
1. Trend Analysis: Explore the malnutrition data for 2013 to identify trends and patterns that can inform public health strategies.
2. Geographic Focus: Highlight states and LGAs with the highest reported burden of malnutrition to guide targeted interventions.
3. Surveillance Insights: Analyze the relationships between observed, reported, and investigated cases to assess the effectiveness of the surveillance system in 2013.

## Impact and Relevance:
The insights gained from this analysis will be vital for public health officials, policymakers, and NGOs in designing interventions to reduce malnutrition in Nigeria. By concentrating on the more reliable 2013 data, this dashboard aims to provide a clear and accurate picture of the malnutrition landscape, aiding in the development of effective strategies to combat this issue.

### Data Limitations:
This analysis is limited to the 2013 data, as 2015 data was excluded due to significant discrepancies. Additionally, the dataset does not include specific nutritional indicators like birth weight, weight-for-age Z-scores, or MUAC measurements, focusing instead on reported cases and deaths.
